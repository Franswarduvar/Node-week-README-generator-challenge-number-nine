# Node-week-README-generator-challenge-number-nine

The goal of my project was to create a README folder generator. Using code that the user interacts with to create a folder, The folder they create displays all of the given data inputs. I accomplished my goal by doing the following:
    1)Creating an inital file structure, downloading inquirer and moving all of the files of starter code into my newly created file structure was how I got started

    2)I phudo coded and did some online research for a couple days before I started coding. After that I got started

    3)I gathered all of the questions needed and started a simple code base, making my constans, prompt and finishing the write to file function I was able to use the generatemarkdown.js file to create a couple things. They are as follows:
        a)First I made my licencing functuions to take the licence data receved and displey the licence to the final read me.
        b)The actual generatemarkdown fucntions might be the most important in the program as it allowed me to give my page a feel and style that dynamically cahnges based on user inpu or lack there of.
Once I had a working and functening code base I created the final demo version of my read me and finished up this one.

The last step of this challenge is to create a short video on screencastify to add as my second link for submission. I hope you enjoy my project :)
